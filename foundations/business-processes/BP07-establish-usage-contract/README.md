# BP07 – Consumer and Provider establish a usage contract for selected catalogue items

> **See also: [Dynamic view](./dynamic-view.md)** — sequence diagram showing how
> this business process executes at runtime, with links to each participating
> solution.

## Overview

This business process addresses scenarios where a _Consumer_ seeks to access
data, application, or infrastructure resources from a _Provider_. Both parties
must establish a legally binding usage contract defining rights, limits, and
obligations of both parties — including pricing, usage limits, data retention
policies, and service level agreements (SLAs).

Usage contracts are established in two scenarios:

1. **New resource consumption** — whenever a _Consumer_ wants to access a new resource from a _Provider_.
2. **Usage contract expiration** — usage contracts are immutable, so a new contract must be created when an existing one expires.

It includes the following main steps:

- **Request usage contract offer**
- **Verify access policy**
- **Verify existence of usage contract**
- **Provide usage contract**
- **Review terms and conditions of usage contract**
- **Sign usage contract** (Consumer)
- **Validate usage contract**
- **Sign usage contract** (Provider)

> **Note:** While the possibility of usage contract term negotiation has been
> discussed, it is not a current requirement in this process.

## Actors

- _Consumer_
- _Provider_ — Infrastructure, Application, or Data Provider

## Assumptions

- The _Consumer_ requests a usage contract based on the selection of a desired resource from the data space catalogue.

## Prerequisites

- **Dataspace is configured** — the _Governance Authority_ has configured the data space catalogue with the corresponding vocabulary and schemas (BP02).
- **End-User authentication and authorisation** — the End-User must be authenticated and possess the necessary roles and permissions to execute the process steps (BP03B).
- **Resource description is present in the data space catalogue** — a resource description must be published in the catalogue (BP05B).

## Process steps

### BP07.01 Request usage contract offer

The _Consumer_ requests a usage contract based on their selection of a desired
resource from the data space catalogue (BP06).

### BP07.02 Verify access policy

The _Provider_ verifies the _Consumer_ description details (as described in
their self-description) to ensure that they are allowed to access the requested
resource according to the access policies.

### BP07.03 Verify existence usage contract

The _Provider_ verifies whether the _Consumer_ already has an established usage
contract in place for the desired resource from the data space catalogue.

### BP07.04 Provide usage contract

The _Provider_ creates a formal usage contract in response to the usage contract
request from the _Consumer_.

### BP07.05 Review terms and conditions of usage contract

The _Consumer_ reviews the usage contract and decides whether to agree to the
terms and conditions.

### BP07.06 Sign usage contract

If the _Consumer_ agrees to the terms and conditions, they sign the usage
contract.

### BP07.07 Store usage contract

The _Consumer_ securely stores the finalised usage contract as part of their
official business records for future reference, compliance, and operational
needs.

### BP07.08 Validate usage contract

The _Provider_ validates that the _Consumer_ has formally agreed to the usage
contract, ensuring they have accepted the terms and conditions established by
the _Provider_.

### BP07.09 Sign usage contract

If the validation is successful, the _Provider_ signs the usage contract.

### BP07.10 Store usage contract

The _Provider_ securely stores the finalised usage contract as part of their
official business records for future reference, compliance, and operational
needs.

### BP07.11 Notify Consumer

The _Provider_ notifies the _Consumer_ that they have signed and stored the
usage contract. The signed usage contract is made available to the _Consumer_.

### BP07.12 Confirm usage contract

The _Consumer_ confirms the signed usage contract from the _Provider_ against
the original usage contract request (from BP07.01), to ensure consistency and
accuracy.

## Outcomes

- **Usage contract is established** — if all steps are completed successfully, the process is finalised and the usage contract is considered active. Both parties are notified of the successful completion of the process.
- **No usage contract established** — if any step fails or is rejected, the process is terminated and no usage contract is established. Both parties are notified of the termination and the reason. This may occur in the following cases:
  - Access policy restriction
  - Existing usage contract
  - Terms and conditions not accepted
  - Usage contract not validated
